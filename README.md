# Starquest 

Starquest is a multiuser text-based science fiction RPG based on Evennia framework.

## Worlds

The game includes multiple nested worlds. The top-level world is a science fiction universe, but each character has their own inner world with internal characters similar to the concept of a plural system with tulpas. The inner worlds are more like fantasy RPGs. A character can enter their own inner world using the _meditate_ command and enter the inner world of another character using the _mindmeld_ command, if their mindmeld skill is powerful enough (mindmeld is not implemented yet). Each character has administrative control of their own inner world, while other characters who join through a mindmeld have visitor level access.

Multiple player accounts are allowed. Players can have multiple characters. Characters can have humanoid or non-humanoid species, with various different natural habitats. Starships typically have multiple habitats to support many different species. Humanoid species include humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, pixies, sprites, fairies and teddy bears. Non-humanoid species include the Cerebrun, the Frenar and the Shadows. Humanity has an extended lifespan thanks to an anti-ageing virus based on elven DNA.

## Factions and Economies

Characters may belong to different factions. Each faction has its own economic system. The Federation of Sentient Beings, for example, uses a system called Federal Collectivism in which money is just as outdated as the barter system. The concept of payment is replaced by the concept of authorization to use a resource, with soft limits based on available resources to determine when a request for authorization needs to be escalated to a higher authority such an elected council or mayor.

There is no universal currency for inter-factional trading.

## Technology

Interstellar travel takes a very long time, but there are a limited number of hyperspace portals through which spacecraft can travel and well as ground-to-space portals that link space stations with the planets below them. Portals can also be placed within starships, through which they are brought to their eventual destination, after centuries or millennia of deep space travel.
