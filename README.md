# The Hyperverse

The Hyperverse is a multiuser text-based RPG based on Evennia framework.

The setting is an infinite ensemble of multiverses.

## Worlds

The game includes multiple nested worlds. The top-level world is a science fiction universe, but each character has their own inner world with internal characters similar to the concept of a plural system with tulpas. The inner worlds are more like fantasy RPGs. A character can enter their own inner world using the _meditate_ command.

Multiple player accounts are allowed. Players can have multiple characters. Each character may belong to one faction and its subfactions, but not to two different factions.
