# Starquest - Infinite Worlds

Starquest - Infinite Worlds is a multiuser text-based science fiction RPG based on Evennia framework.

## Worlds

The game includes multiple nested worlds. The top-level world is a science fiction universe, but each character has their own inner world with internal characters similar to the concept of a plural system with tulpas. The inner worlds are more like fantasy RPGs. A character can enter their own inner world using the _meditate_ command and enter the inner world of another character using the _mindmeld_ command, if their mindmeld skill is powerful enough (mindmeld is not implemented yet). Each character has administrative control of their own inner world, while other characters who join through a mindmeld have visitor level access.

Multiple player accounts are allowed. Players can have multiple characters. Each character may belong to one faction and its subfactions, but not to two different factions.
