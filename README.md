# The Hyperverse

The Hyperverse is a multiuser text-based RPG based on Evennia framework.

The setting is an infinite ensemble of multiverses, known as the Grand Ensemble Multiverse (GEM), with nested inner worlds within the minds of sentient beings.

## Grand Ensemble Multiverse (GEM) [Science Fiction - Space Opera Genre]

The Grand Ensemble Multiverse is a Quantum Multiverse, in accordance with the Many Worlds Interpretation of Qunantum Mechanics, in which each World is contained within the Cosmic 11-dimensional spacetime Bulk of M-Theory.

The physical universe is a four-dimensional spacetime, which can interact, gravitionaly, with other nearby spacetime regions, known as Etheric Universes. In some cases, super-strings, known as Etheric Strings may be attached at each end to two different Branes.

The gravitional influence of Etheric Strings and Etheric Universes, account for the missing "Dark Matter" and "Dark Energy" within the physical universe.

An Etheric Body is formed through the gravitional influence of a physical body. It may have consciousness and continue to exist, even after the destruction of the physical body around which it was formed.

## Inner Worlds [High Fantasy Genre]

The game includes multiple nested _inner_ worlds. The top-level world is the Grand Ensemble Multiverse (GEM), but each character has their own inner world with internal characters similar to the concept of a plural system with tulpas. The inner worlds are more like high fantasy than space-opera science-fiction. A character can enter their own inner world using the _meditate_ command.

Multiple player accounts are allowed. Players can have multiple characters. Each character may belong to one faction and its subfactions, but not to two different factions.
